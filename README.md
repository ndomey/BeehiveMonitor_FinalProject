<h1>Beehive_Monitor - FinalProject</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p style="font-size:10px">HiveGuard is a prototype of a beehive monitor system. Its purpose is to observe bee traffic entering and exiting a hive. The project consists of two main parts: an app collecting sensor data with a function of sending email notification when a potential swarming is detected and a web application visualising the data.</p>
